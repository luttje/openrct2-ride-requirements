# Ride Bonus and Requirements Viewer (OpenRCT2)

This is a small plugin that shows the bonuses and requirements of a rides in
the game.

I made this mostly to test if my contribution to OpenRCT2 is working. That
contribution is a the binding of `RideTypeDescriptor`, `RideRatingsDescriptor`
and `RatingsModifier` to the scripting API.
